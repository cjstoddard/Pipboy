1. Why did I make this?

   My wife wanted a cospaly prop and I got carried away.

2. Why did I use Gambas?

   Gambas is a good prototyping tool, it is pretty easy to get a quick and dirty app up and running with a minimal amount of fuss. I could have used Python, C or C++, but it would have tripled the amount of time I spent coding it.

3. Why did I use the Miuzei Raspberry Pi 4 Touchscreen?

   Primarily because I had one laying around not doing anything. Also it is a complete kit, it comes with heat sinks, fan, LCD and most importantly a open case with places to attach straps and such. The kit is also reasonably priced at $30.

4. Will it work with other small screens like the Adafruit 3.5" PiTFT?

   Yes, however the program is optimized for a 4" screen with a resolution of 800x480. If your screen does not support 800x480, then you will need to modify the code to resize the forms and components.

5. Why when I run this on a Raspbery Pi on a monitor, the Data tab is scrambled?

  I do not know. It has something to do with the webview component, but otherwise, I have no clue.

6. When will you have a Pipboy arm band shell for this setup?

  I am working it. This is the toughest part for me, so it is going to take a while. Sorry.
